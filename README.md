# Game Library [![Badge License]][License]

*A game library extension for* ***[EmulatorJS]***

An already-hosted online version can be found here: https://temporusweb.com

<br>

This add - on site allows users of EmulatorJS to manage ROMs and family accounts.<br>

PSX has been dropped temporarily, as well as bios support. These will be re-added in future updates.<br> 

<br>

## Installation

This is a drag and drop extension, with the <br>
exception that it requires something to host <br>
PHP files like XAMPP. After that, simply register using the on-site registration and upload your roms. Bulk rom uploading has been added to make this easier.

## Roadmap
This will be updated more when I have a better idea of what this project will entail. For now, I only plan on adding admin customizable settings (Colors, site title)

## Contributions

Any (positive) additions or changes are welcome and encouraged.
